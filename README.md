#pnc-cli
A python CLI around the PNC REST API

Installation:
 * pip install pnc-cli

Usage:
 * Configure the REST endpoint for PNC in USER_HOME/.config/pnc-cli/pnc-cli.conf
 * pnc -h for a list of valid operations.

Currently outputs the raw JSON. More refined output is definitely in the works :) 

Versioning:
 * There are currently two dev streams on this project; one uses the REST api from PNC's master branch, the other uses the v0.8 stream, for now.
